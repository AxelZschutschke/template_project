# Overview 

Document authors: A. Zschutschke

This document is created as template for teaching purposes, please adapt to
your own project needs. Usually, your organisation should supply a Test Policy
document, which acts as basis for the organisation's \ref TestStrategy as well.

Please refer to the [definitions page](\ref Definitions) for details of
specific key words and phrases and explanation for abbreviations.

## Introduction

*ISO 29119* sets up this document as the top level (and most generic) test document in your
organisation, setting the north star for all test activities regarding their:

* motivation and objectives
* overall test process
* test organisation structure
* tester training and ethics
* standards
* measuring / assessment the value of testing
* asset archiving and reusing
* process improvement

From this, the test strategy for (parts of) the organisation can be forged, setting more
concrete guidelines for the actual test process in the organisation and how to implement
the target level of test quality. See *ISO 29119 part 2* for more details on the Test
Policy document, while the above bullet list should assemble a usable outline.
