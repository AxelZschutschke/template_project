Introduction</h2>
<p>The test documentation gives an overview of test targets, test scope and defines and explains the internal notations. Also, an overview of the test environment and the test approach is presented.</p>
<p>During a release cycle all test related documents are updated according to their natural dependency. The <a class="el" href="TestStrategy.html">test strategy</a> is the most stable document (time-wise), as it describes general definitions and the long term test approach. The <a class="el" href="TestPlan.html">test plan</a> will be adapted to new features and found defects, for the next release while the test report is virtually subject to change with each new build.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md54"></a>
Scope</h2>
<p>The test strategy document shall define the goal of all activities related to test and quality. It should align all developers, testers and other relevant stakeholders with regards to a common understanding of quality goals and test related notation. The document shall be reviewed and agreed on by developers, testers and other relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>Testing activities are conducted in a continuous manner, meaning that with every product iteration, the quality gates for releasing the respective increment to customers shall be assessed and be reached prior to shipment. The main goal of the testing activities is to detect errors early, while creating a culture of quality awareness and an open error culture. Error reports are appreciated at any point of the development cycle to enable transparent defect management.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md55"></a>
Requirements</h2>
<p>Requirements can be destinquished into two different levels and two different types:</p>
<div class="dotgraph">
<iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="dot_inline_dotgraph_5.svg" width="448" height="251"><p><b>This browser is not able to show SVG: try Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera instead.</b></p></iframe></div>
<p>Requirements on <b>technical level</b> shall be reflected by the review process and the acceptance criteria of development activities. They are created during technical analysis of the problem and software design. There is little to no cutomer gain and feedback for such requirements.</p>
<p>Requirements on the <b>stakeholder level</b> are based on stakeholder request and describe the features the software product shall include. They are directly evaluated by the stakeholder and should be explicitely tested.</p>
<p><b>Functional</b> requirements are usually introduced as feature request, describing the functionality of the software product.</p>
<p><b>Non-functional</b> requirements are more delicate, as they are often expected silently by stakeholders. They must be asked explitely from stakeholders and some must be formulated by development.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
Test Approach</h2>
<p>Facing the requirements of continuous integration, the test process must be adapted. Here, methods of continuous testing will be applied to ensure a high level of quality of the product while keeping the pace of modern development.</p>
<p><b>Continuos testing</b> is a pipeline strategy, not bound to dedicated testing phases and with different closed feedback loops. [1]</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Legal / Regulations</h2>
<p>The test procedure also takes legal aspects into considerations, including the (redistributable) license status of all components used, legal regulations for the acceptance and permissions to release the system and the applicance of standard specifications.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken for open source software components used in the product, as they have different and potentially very restrictive license types. Also, law is very specific with respect to using these components, as the full test responsibility is remaining by the product using the open source software.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
Test Levels</h2>
<p>There are four levels of testing considered in this project:</p><ul>
<li>unit test</li>
<li>integration test</li>
<li>sub-system test</li>
<li>system test</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount and intesity of testing together with the level of automation is decreasing from unit to system test level. The higher test levels, e.g. sub-system and system test also include all external components to assure the correct integration and interaction of the product with the environment. The test levels are not bound to software test alone but also include documentation and design as well as all other (testable) artifacts, prepared during product development.</p>
<h3>Unit Test</h3>
<p>Test of the smallest building blocks of the software. The test focusses on a single method or class, calling a public interface and evaluating its result. Three different types of results can be evaluated (while one test should only evaluate one of the three): the returned value, a measurable change of the state of the system or by the way an other part of the system is called. Side effects and integration effects should be excluded from the unit test, to ensure the consistency and repeadability of the test.</p>
<p>The unit test is a developer-oriented test and is usually designed and implemented by the author of the code. An independend review should be carried out to ensure sharpness of the test. Unit tests are completely automated, consistent and fast, which makes them available for regression testing on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Integration Test</h3>
<p>The integration test very similar to an unit test. The main difference is that the integration test is not actively avoiding internal dependencies, while still not openly relying on external dependencies. Target is to verify the correct interaction and collaboration of the internal components via their interfaces.</p>
<h3>Sub-System Test</h3>
<p>The unit and integration test extract parts of the software and create a "virtual" environment for the tests to run in. The sub-system test shall partly overcome this limitation and test the individual packages of the final product as shipped, while still simulating parts of the interaction of other packages and/or hardware.</p>
<h3>System Test</h3>
<p>The system test shall test the product under real world conditions, with all external and internal components in place and on the target hardware. As this would create an infinite number of test scenarios with different environments and component versions, dedicated test scenarios need to be identified, which shall represent all imaginable combinations.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md59"></a>
Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Any team member of the developer team can take on one or more of the following roles for his/her work. Sometimes, it may be beneficial to employ dedicated testers and developers, but often, they may double up on both roles. For high level test, a different person should test the product than the one who implemented it. Also, peer reviews shall protect from soft testing.</p>
<p>For details on the role's responsibilities, please refer to the definition page.</p>
<p>A team consists of one <b>product owner</b> and a development team. The development team should staff the following roles:</p><ul>
<li>one <b>team quality representative</b></li>
<li>one <b>team architect</b></li>
<li>several <b>developers</b></li>
<li>several <b>testers</b></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Types of Testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>white box</li>
<li>black box</li>
<li>static</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md61"></a>
Explorative Testing</h2>
<p>Next to the thoroughly planned test tasks during sub-system and system test a less restricted approach is explorative testing. This approach is used to find "new defects" by setting the developers, testers or other stakeholders into an unconstrained test scenario. A general topic and state of mind is set to begin with, then a time boxed test session without any rules or concrete test steps is conducted and recorded. This approach allows for a more creative setup and "random" findings, which are triggered by certain chain of events unforseeable or overseen by the test plan. It is beneficial to have a test document with a fixed checklist to query the whole test environment. The list is filled prior to testing, so that in case of an finding, a complete error report can be created with ease and no questions about the actual situation and versions arrise.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md62"></a>
Security Testing</h2>
<p>Security in terms of data security and ITSec is an crucial part of any modern system. Special care must be taken to ensure the secure and uninterrupted operation of the system, even in case of targeted attacks against the system. Applying a set of secure coding guidelines, which can be enforced by analyis tools and code reviews, can help to reduce attack vectors against the system. The test activities with respect to security shall be conducted by specially trained professionals. The budget and time for this analysis must be planned early in the project.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md63"></a>
Environment</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md64"></a>
Test Object</h2>
<ul>
<li>description of the product, its application and use cases</li>
<li>requirements of the product towards its execution environment</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md65"></a>
Physical Environment (target)</h2>
<ul>
<li>description of the (hardware) target platform for the (software) product</li>
<li>required system resources</li>
<li>discussion of specific aspects and risks (cross-compiling, reduced system resources...)</li>
<li>availabilty (and discussion of quality) of the hardware and virtual environments</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md66"></a>
Software Environment</h2>
<ul>
<li>interaction with base / operating system</li>
<li>description of external and interface components</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md67"></a>
Test Tools</h2>
<p>For different levels of testing, different tools and environments are utilized. For unit- and integration tests, a unit test and isolation framework is used, which provides means for faking parts of the runtime system and creates executable binaries, which internally call the parts of the system under test, which are focussed at by the active test case. They are compiling the test report and execute the test cases in a configurable order (e.g. in random order, to make sure the test cases are independend of each other). Here, the google testing framework is used for these low level tests.</p>
<p>For higher test levels, the actual artifacts of the product built are used as test specimens. They are relying on the actual platform they are built for and may lack to "set up" defined test conditions artificially. For this, the artifacts are executed in a virtual (sub-system test) environment or on the actual target (system test), which creates a set of obstacles, especially for test automation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md68"></a>
Reporting</h2>
<p>The tools used for testing create a junit-style test result file in xml format. The coverage is presented as raw coverage file, as generated by the coverage tools. The dashboard application and CI chain can read these files to create trends of code coverage, test executed and failed next to the build results.</p>
<p>The visualization of test results is done within the documentation of the project. The documentation shall include:</p><ul>
<li>code documentation</li>
<li>architectural documentation (C4 model)</li>
<li>test documentation</li>
<li>active requirements</li>
<li>list of open (known) defects</li>
<li>changelog, incl. closed defects</li>
<li>test report of the current build</li>
</ul>
<p>Using this approach, a complete and archivable artifact is created without external dependencies.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md69"></a>
Defect Tracking</h2>
<ul>
<li>tool used for defect tracking and brief description</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md70"></a>
Definition of Done</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md71"></a>
Reviews</h2>
<p>Reviews shall be carried out for all design documentation and all implemented code, be it production or test code. For test code, a walkthrough is sufficient as review, for design documents and production code (inluding the code generated by pair-programming), a dedicated peer review shall be carried out by at least one peer.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md72"></a>
Coverage</h2>
<p>As the test process has no natural completed critereon, the test coverage is used as end-of test indicator for the low level test types (unit and integration testing). Given reviewed test cases, the coverage becomes a valid measure for the overall status of testing. Both test levels shall cover 100 % of statements and at least 100 % of branches. Modified condition/decision coverage is used as measure for code of highest integrety requirements, which is not the case here, thus basic branch coverage is a sufficient measure.</p>
<p>The higher test levels are measured based on the requirements. Here, a requirement coverage is defined, and set to 100 % as target coverage criterion. That means that all requirements applicable for a given software release shall be tested by at least one test scenario, specifically designed for this requirement. Requirements may be tested on lower test levels, which would make a re-test on system level optional.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md73"></a>
Automation</h2>
<p>The project aims for a high degree of test automation. For unit and low-level integration testing, full automation shall be reached (100% of tests). For higher test levels, individual test cases might be hard or impossible to automate. For these, a detailed instruction and questionaire shall be created to ensure repeatability and expressiveness of the test result. The test then may be carried out manually, following the questionaire. Overall, 80 % of test cases shall be automated.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md74"></a>
Reporting</h2>
<p>The product documentation, release notes and test report are sent to the test manager for review and approval <b>1 week</b> before the planned release.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md75"></a>
Documentation</h2>
<p>The changelog for the current release is present and the user documentation is updated. A review is carried out in peer review manner and no open points review findings are remaining.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md76"></a>
Defect management</h2>
<p>The defect management includes all steps from adding newly found defects to the defect tracking tool, the defect triage, fixing the source location, retesting and accepting the fix. Defects are prioritized in the defect triage. Here, also the scope of the fix (or the termination of the defect) are decided as well as a time schedule. The defect will be rated regarding its severity. For defects of medium and high severity, the release documentations need to be adapted, for announcing the issue to users.</p>
